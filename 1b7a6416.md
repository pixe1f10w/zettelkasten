# Writable subdirectory in macOS root

Starting with macOS Catalina, root filesystem became read-only and that makes it difficult to install Nix. There is a corresponding key in Nix installer, but should it fail for some reason it is possible to overcome it as follows. 

To create a /nix directory you can write to:

    echo 'nix' | sudo tee -a /etc/synthetic.conf
    
Now reboot or do:

	/System/Library/Filesystems/apfs.fs/Contents/Resources/apfs.util -B

Run the following commands afterwards:

	sudo diskutil apfs addVolume disk1 APFSX Nix -mountpoint /nix
	sudo diskutil enableOwnership /nix
	sudo chflags hidden /nix  # Don't show the Nix volume on the desktop
	echo "LABEL=Nix /nix apfs rw" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

After that it should be possible to install Nix as usual.
