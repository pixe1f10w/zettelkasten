# Slow Midnight Commander startup

I've faced that issue on macOS Catalina in particular. Problem in a nutshell: mc tries to resolve a hostname on startup for some reason, so if it is unresolvable, it will hang for about 30 seconds or so, which is unbearable.

So:

	hostname  # -> mac.local, e.g.
	sudo nvim /etc/hosts  # and add
	
	...
	127.0.0.1	mac.local
	...

Then restart mc and it should start far quickly.
