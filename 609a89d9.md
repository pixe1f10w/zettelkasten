# Disabling generation of special symbols with Option modifier on macOS

macOS has a neat feature of generating of special symbols while holding Option (Alt) key -- like Option+B -> ∫, Option+S -> ß and so on -- which is nice, but can be an obstacle when you want to use some shortcuts in particular software.
Unfortunately (and expectable) there is no stock way to avoid that behaviour, but there is a workaround for that described at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11876485/how-to-disable-generating-special-characters-when-pressing-the-alta-optiona:

1. Download and run Ukelele from http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele
2. File -> New Based On Current Input Source
3. Click Modifiers button
4. Take your time to become accustomed to peculiarities of program interface
5. Select each modifier from list that have Left Down or Right Down in the Option column
6. Press the minus button for each like this
7. Go to Keyboard menu -> Set Keyboard Name
8. Change the name somehow to make it easier to identify
9. Go to File -> Save as
10. Save to ~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/ with suffix .keylayout
11. Restart
12. Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources
13. Hit the + button -> Others -> Your new layout should be available
14. Add the new layout
15. Go off to [[a6fe7cdf|new adventure]] of removing default layout (which is impossible by default)
